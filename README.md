Access Android SQLite(Room Database) From Cpp Native Library

In this project, we need to access the room SQLite database and read in CPP code
the first, created an android native project and added the room library to the project, and created a new database with a "Sample" table

Step 2 I tried to add sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c library source code to native CPP code
this answer helped me to do this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/53643025/5001111

Step 3 use this c++ sample code to read the database: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_c_cpp.htm

I hope it helps you.
